Project Summary
1. This project asked me to make a class that acted like a shopping center. I created two maps, a command processing loop enclosing a switch statement, and a method for each instruction. The input was a text file with several objects with prices next to them. They were processed with the scanner class, and a while loop. the out put was a loooong list of things people in order, put in their basket, then took out, checked how much everything was, and then checked out.
2. In this project, I used two tree maps to help me organize everything. Tree maps are nice because you can search for a particular key/value, without much hassle. Values are associated with unique keys, and its very expandable(unlike arrays:p)
3. The program took in two text files. While one text file right away got put into its map, the second one went through different methods before being put into the map. When it was first read in, immediately, it got shuffled through a switch case, which then went to different methods. I used java.util, java.util.Scanner, and java.io. to help me handle the different operations I used in the class. 
4. I used looooooottttsss of print statements. I used them right after the methods are called, before the switch statements after if statements to check if I was getting the right values I was expecting. I deleted most of the print statements because they were distracting, but I left some in.
5. I learned a lot about treeMaps, the ins and outs of certain methods, reviewing switch cases, instantiation. Also, I had never called a file before like that so that was cool(calling the args and what not). Formatting was a bit of a struggle at first, but then I got it. How the keys and values were stored from multiple errors.
